Q1) In previous labs, adding a peripheral has required pin initializations. Why were able to add 
the nunchuk without initializing anything?

We were able to add the nunchuck because it is an I2C.


Q2) What are the major differences between these two functions and what does that imply about 
communicating with the nunchuk?

The I2C_TransferHandling is set to AutoEnd_Mode instead of SoftEnd_Mode. This implies that the nunchuck automatically accepts the data.

Q3) What do all of these variables correspond to in the nunchuk?

  unsigned char jx; joystick up/down
  unsigned char jy; joystick left/right
  unsigned short ax; movement in x direction
  unsigned short ay; movement in y direction
  unsigned short az; movement in z direction
  unsigned char c; c button
  unsigned char z; z button

Q4) Explain the code.

Raw data from the nunchuck is read. At the first 2 bites, the left most bit corresponds to the z button and the right most corresponds to c button.

Difficulties: 

I had a difficult time getting the bar graph for the nunchuck accelerometer to expand.

What Did I Learn?: 

I learned what data the nunchuck reads and how it can determine which way the joystick is being moved using two variables.
