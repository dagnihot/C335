1. Speed = 24MHz, Flash = 128k bytes, 8k bytes RAM
2. General Purpose Input Output
4. Pins 15, 11 Port E
5. GPIO_PIN, GPIO_Mode, GPIO_Speed, GPIO_OType, GPIO_PuPd

We encountered a few minor difficulties in getting the button to turn on all of the pins. We 
overcame this by making sure to add all of the pins to the led_on and led_off functions.
