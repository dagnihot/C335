Dhruv Agnihotri
Lab 10 - report

Difficulties:
I had some difficulties with the LED Slow Motion in getting the LEDs to 
cycle when the button was pressed at the 10Hz rate and then going back to 
100 when released.

What did I learn?:
I learned that the Systick provides a periodic interrupt based a frequency 
that is passed in when the device is configured
