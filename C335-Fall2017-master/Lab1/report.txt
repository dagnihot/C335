Results: I made two versions of the Hello World program. I got the second one to print a countdown timer

Difficulties: I had trouble initially making the counter decrement, but I made a change to pass a different variable and it worked.

Stuff i learned: I learned the basics of commands in Unix and how to write and compile programs in C with emacs.
