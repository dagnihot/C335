How many volts? 2.5
Where is it located at? It is located between the user button and the reset button


2. Why do we write to the accelerometer/magnetometer before we can read from them?
To specify the return location and how it functions.

   What are the following lines of code doing?
Each line is sending and storing data to the accelerometer/magnetometer

3. What do the following lines of code do? (it is only necessary to explain the accelerometer)

It captures the data from the accelerometer. Raw data is taken and converted into a float which is 
then stored in an array. A left shift of 8 is used to multiply the original number. The final 
answer is stored as a 16 bit int.

4. Why might it be necessary to tilt compensate your compass computation?

It may be nessesary to compensate the compass computation because the board position can determine 
if the reading is accurate or not.
