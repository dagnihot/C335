Q1.) What are we doing here and how does it relate to what we know about SPI?

SD_CS_HIGH() – data is transferred through the pins
SD_CS_LOW() – communication of data between the processor and SD card is stopped. 
This synchronous communication acts similarly to SPI.


Q2.) Explain how you might use the *f3d_delay_uS()* function within the *delay()* function to replace the delay loop below. What would you expect to be the advantage of using a timer 
over a delay loop?

The *f3d_delay_uS()* function can be used within the *delay()* function to produce a more finite delay time.
An advantage to using a timer over a delay loop would be that a timer would allow for more accuracy within the functionality of the code.



Q3.) Read chapter 12 in the lab manual which covers DMA (direct memory access). Why might DMA be important in improving the performance of your image display application?

DMA allows for an increase in pixels drawn on the LCD. 
With DMA – 735k pixels/second are processed. 
Without DMA – 50k pixels/second are processed.


Q4.) Research the FAT file system and describe the function of the file allocation table. Explain
how the corruption of an entry in the table can cause part of a file to be lost.

The FAT file system locates files in the disk. If two files are of the same name, the file can become corrupt and lost.



Q5.) What is the difference between FAT16 and FAT32?

The difference between FAT16 and FAT32 is that FAT16 sets a limit on the entries allowed in the root folder, whereas FAT32 does not.


Difficulties: The most difficult portion of this lab was getting the pictures to display on the LCD. Some things that contributed to our problems were that our rgb values 
in one the files was flipped to be gbr. Also, one of the pins wasn't properly configured in the driver.

What I learned: I learned that the SD Card uses SPI functionality. I also learned how the LCD screen display works with the accelerometer values.
