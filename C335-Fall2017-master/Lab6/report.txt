1) Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of printf debugging?

Printf debugging is a good way to catch common problems. However, it is limited in versatility of understanding specific code and hardware issues which can be a serious disadvantage.


2) Explain why the spiReadWrite function is called inside a higher level peripheral function (the lcdWrite function).

It sets up communication between the processor and the LCD.

3) Why does LCD_CS_DEASSERT() do? Why is it important?

LCD_CS_DEASSERT() sets the LCD CS to high. This is important it tells us that the master is not communicating with the LCD peripheral.


4) Explain how the character data from the ASCII array in glcdfont.c gets converted to pixels.

The data goes through a nested for-loop and iterates through each column of the character and finds the column of pixels for the ith character. After that it iterates through and determines whether or not a pixel should be drawn at that a specific vertical point in that column.


5) Give the exact timing difference between the two versions of f3d_lcd_fillScreen, from the Salae analyzer, and explain why the new function is faster.

Run time of initial version: 209 ms. 
Run time of second version: 72 ms.
Difference: 209 - 72 = 137 ms. 

The new function communicates with the LCD less often, but gives more information per communication session. Thus it is faster and more efficient.


Difficulties: 

We had a few difficulties in making the LCD screen turn red but it was due to a syntax issue that we fixed early in the lab. We also had to use a little bit of finesse in making the bar graph spacing so that all of the bars would show and the space in between them was about the same.
